Indoor Guide Drone for Visually Impaired People

**Project Goal:**  
Develop a real-time drone navigation system using computer vision to autonomously follow a person wearing an ArUco marker indoors, with robust fallback tracking and obstacle avoidance. This system aims at assisting visually impaired individuals in navigating indoor environments.

## üìå Overview

This project integrates:
- **ArUco marker tracking** for precise pose estimation
- **YOLOv5n + Deep SORT** as fallback tracker
- **MiDaS depth estimation** for real-time obstacle avoidance
- **PD controller** for drone movement stabilization
- **DJI Tello EDU** as the aerial platform
- **Single-camera monocular vision** as input

The drone follows the user, avoids obstacles (walls, doorframes), and handles sharp turns and temporary visual loss using fallback logic.

## üß† Methodology

### 1. **ArUco Marker Detection**
- Pose estimation: `cv2.aruco.estimatePoseSingleMarkers`
- Extracts marker center, distance, and yaw angle from `rvec` + `tvec`
- Used to derive control commands:
  - `yaw` ‚Üí align heading with marker angle
  - `lr`  ‚Üí lateral correction
  - `fb`  ‚Üí forward-backward distance control
  - `ud`  ‚Üí altitude stabilization

### 2. **Fallback Tracking: YOLO + Deep SORT**
- Activates when marker is lost for > N frames
- Uses the nearest "person" bounding box based on last known ArUco position
- Maintains smooth control using visual tracking and position memory

### 3. **Obstacle Avoidance**
- Uses MiDaS to generate depth maps
- Computes mean depth and depth gradient near path line
- If obstacle detected < threshold distance, halts or redirects
- Obstacle override has highest priority

### 4. **PD Controller with Smoothing**
- Stabilizes drone motion via proportional-derivative control
- Smooths jitter using:
  - Low-pass filtering
  - Deadbands and clipping
  - Turn-based dynamic acceleration logic

## üß™ Evaluation

| Metric                             | Value / Notes |
|-----------------------------------|----------------|
| ArUco Tracking Latency            | ~7 ¬± 1‚ÄØms                              |
| Obstacle Detection Recall         | ~90% (‚â•0.7 IoU on 1200 labeled frames) |
| End-to-End Avoidance Success      | 85% of 40 indoor corner runs           |
| Turn Responsiveness               | Drone reduces radius and accelerates during sharp marker yaw changes |
| Stability                         | Controlled oscillation with PID smoothing and min-speed gating       |

## üîß Requirements

- macOS or Linux (tested on MacBook M1 Pro)
- Python 3.10+
- OpenCV, Torch, djitellopy, Ultralytics YOLOv5, Deep SORT, MiDaS

Install with:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## üéÆ Controls

| Key | Action             |
|-----|--------------------|
| `s` | Takeoff            |
| `l` | Land               |
| `q` | Emergency Quit     |

## üí° Lessons Learned

- Accurate yaw angle from ArUco is critical for understanding user turns
- Dynamic prioritization (obstacle > tracking > fallback) prevents most indoor failures
- PID tuning alone is insufficient‚Äîmust combine with deadbands, dynamic clipping, and smoothing
- TorchScript YOLOv5n significantly reduces inference latency on Mac

## üìà Future Work

- Replacing fallback tracking with person re-ID for long occlusion handling  
- Integrating LLM voice assistant for verbal guidance  
- Exploring stereo/depth camera module to replace MiDaS

- Avoid obstacles by sending RC commands with speed adjustments based on proximity information from different regions.

search_memory()
- Search for ArUco marker using memory of its last known position and direction.

capture_frames()
- State machine to control the drone's behavior based on the current mode and detected obstacles by continuously capturing frames and listening for key presses
